#### Rules:

> **brain-even** - user is shown a random number. And he needs to answer **yes** if the number is even, or **no** if it is odd;

> **brain-calс** - user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example 35 + 16, which needs to be calculated and written down the correct answer;

> **brain-gcd** - two random numbers are shown to the user, for example, 25 50. The user must calculate and enter the largest common divisor of these numbers;

> **brain-progression** - the player is shown a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression in which one of the numbers is replaced by two points. The player must determine this number;

> **brain-prime** - user is shown a random number. And he needs to answer **yes** if the number is prime, or **no** if not.
